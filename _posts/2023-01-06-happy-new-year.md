It has been a while to say the least. Work has gotten busy again, but I'm still committed to this catalog. I'm happy to say I've released an MVP of my side project. You can explore it [here](https://github.com/shpwrck/gloo-mesh-example). It's barebones and only works on a limited subset, but it's progress. I think now that I have the weekend at my disposal, that my next post will be on dynamic platform.
