Hey reader! I'm from Buffalo, and we just had a "generational" weather event. The sort of event you spend days shoveling yourself out of. Although the weather did afford me plenty of idle time, it is mostly unrelated to why this post exists or any that follow. The one exception is that I've found myself buried in an existential sense. I'm currently buried under heaps of guilt, fear, confusion, and general malaise in my professional existence. I'm trying to shovel my way out. You can track my progress on this website, but I do not make any guarantees on the content. This is a device designed for self recovery and little else. Do let me know if you find it useful or want to explore my progress, however. Cheers!
